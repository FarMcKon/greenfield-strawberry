# Greenfield Strawberry

This is a personal project tests of making a Graph QL UI 
connected to a backend in SQLAlchmey, and using Alembic to 
manage "versioning as code" 

I am surprised there isn't an existing tool for this, and while 
reading a job description, I wanted to run a 'spike' on 
building one
